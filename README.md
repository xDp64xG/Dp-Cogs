# Battleship


Welcome to my first cog. I made this little Battleship game, and converted it into where a bot on discord can use. This code "Battleship.py" is very messy still, but is being cleaned up after thorough testing. Any suggestions or issues, use the issues page and post them, thanks!

Versions:

	1.0:
		Now able to cancel the game with the words "cancel"
		Now able to take X and Y at the same time!
		New grid, which is also posted at the beginning of each game
		Now able to only respond to the sender of the command and to only respond where the command came from
	1.1:
		New Grid with Discord Emojies
		Added function of editing the embed instead of reposting
		Now deletes the asking of X and Y coords.
		Now able to prevent most cases of the bot malafunction with a improper message, able to catch the error
	1.2:
		Now able to edit the embed
		Added a timeout of 30 seconds
		Able to send "is typing" message
		Edited embed( Turns)
	1.3:
		Timeout now works!
		Able to send the "is typing" message
		The board embed now shows your turns
		3 outputs at the end of the game, if you cancel, no input, and Game Over(and if you get all the ships)
		Output 1 - Send "cancel", it only says "Stopping Game."
		Output 2 - Wait for 30 seconds and no input, says "Error. No input, stopping game."
		Output 3 - When you don't sink all ships, you get the board where the ships were and "Game Over"
		Output 4(still working on for the end) - Basically congrats on hitting all the ships.
	1.4:
		New embed colours depending on the game status
		Fixing Guide
		Fixed some bug fixes for stopping the game
	1.5:
		Added authors name onto the board to clarify who is playing
		When the game is canceled or get no response, everything deletes.
		At the end of the game, only the board is left and the final message
		Changed the instructions to the board(used emojies to show the board places)
	2.0:
		Now isn't linked to a singular bot
		Seperate commands to just play the game, one to see how to play(may change the wording([p]battlehelp)
	To-Do:
		Add where I can have a currency and give it to you based on the ships you have sunk, economy api?
		

# Tail Cog

	1.0:
		This is to see parts of the command line if you aren't running your bot Locally, and find why your cog won't load, ones you create/install
		I did not create this Cog, but made this so I can add it to my bot easily. <Author>
		
		
		
# Youtube Announcer

	1.0:
		Want to check the latest upload or want to let everyone know there is a upload? Use this. Only works for hardcoded URL at the time, will be setting that up and a how to. Keep an eye out for that.
	1.1:
		Added in where you can set the URL. Does not mean its currently working.
 	# Requirements:
		Beautiful Soup
		
# Goldfish Card Game
	1.0:
		Added a functioning card game between 2 players. There are many issues still, but much less than there has been
	1.1:
		Fixed a small error for getting a user. Should seperate by a barrier, not empty space
	
	Bugs:
		Player one is able to get matches, Player 2 can't. 
		Very annoying messages, working on having edited messages(not a bug, but still should be here I guess).
		The cards Jack, Queen, and King are not functioning properly, as there are no matches.
		You shouldn't be able to ask for cards you don't have, will implement where the game doesn't crash.

# Message Counter (To be renamed)
	1.0:
		Count Messages sent in your server, just a little thing made up for keeping track of activity
	1.5:
		Expanding into keeping a total count, hope to add in caluclations from total message count, which should be included into setup
		Added functionality of multiple guilds/servers being tracked

	Bugs:
		Must make sure Claims is properly being tracked and updated.

# Stars (To be renamed)
	1.0:
		Add 'points' by mention. Just a way to publicly show points for participation in community events
	2.0:
		Added functionality of multiple servers/guilds. Added customization settings. Added random picker out of all points linked to per person
